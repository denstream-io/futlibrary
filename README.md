# FutLibrary

A progressive app for setting tests/exams for students; Sending regular blog updates to new(fresher) and returning campus students. 
Built using the Flask framework.
 
# Description
**FutLibrary**, an acronym for the *Federal University of Technology Library*, is a remarkable creation born from the mind of a brilliant student, designed exclusively for students like us. This app brings a new dimension to educational institutes, whether it be universities, polytechnics, colleges of education, or even primary and secondary schools. It serves as a platform for setting level-based tests, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of knowledge. Not only limited to formal academic settings, FutLibrary can also be employed for light-hearted and enjoyable quizzes among colleagues or students. Whether for serious learning or simply having a blast, this app has got you covered. It's the ultimate fusion of education and fun, paving the way for an exciting and engaging learning experience for all.

# Inspiration
As students at FUTMINNA (Federal University of Technology, Minna), we have identified a pressing need for a unifying tool that can enhance our academic journey. Our vision is to create a platform that fosters collaboration and supports us in achieving academic excellence. This innovative platform aims to bring together student-tutors and lecturers, ecourageing them to go beyond traditional classroom tutorials. By enabling tutors to set subject-based tests, we believe it would not only impart knowledge but also assess students' test-taking abilities, thereby preparing them thoroughly for upcoming examinations. This dynamic tool will serve as a catalyst for academic growth, promoting a cohesive and empowering learning environment for everyone.

### And thus **FutLibrary** was born :D

# How we built it
1. The web application has been built using Flask.
2. We used the applcation refactory method and Blueprints in Flask
3. We used the Bootstrap Library for styling our web application.

# Challenges we ran into
1. At the outset, we encountered challenges in determining the structure of our database relation. However, thanks to the convenience and efficiency of the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), we were able to streamline this process. By thoroughly studying its documentation and examining code samples, we gained a solid understanding of the ORM's capabilities and its practicality in our project.
2. Given our team's lack of expertise in UI design, the task of designing and styling components has proven to be a persistent challenge. We initially grappled with CSS, followed by an extensive exploration of numerous libraries and web templates. However, after careful consideration, we found solace in the BootStrap library/framework, which provided much-needed relief by simplifying the process. Despite the ongoing nature of the challenge, our decision to embrace BootStrap has proven invaluable.

# Challenges we are currently facing
1. As mentioned earlier, we are currently facing ongoing challenges with the frontend UI development. If you possess expertise in front-end design, we warmly welcome your support and contribution to our project. Your proficiency in this area could greatly assist us in overcoming our current hurdles and creating a more polished and user-friendly user interface. Feel free to join us on this journey and help us enhance the frontend design of our project.

# Acommplishments that we're proud of
1. Embarking on our very first real-world project using the Flask framework has been an exciting endeavor for us. Our ability to grasp and utilize the Flask framework effectively has brought us a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction
2. 

# What we learned
We learned how to:
  1. use Flask to manage the back-end of the web app
  2. use JavaScript tho manage the front-end logics


# What's next for **FutLibrary**
The various ideas that we do intend to implement in HackyHelper:
  1. Internal chat messaging functionality
  2.
